In this task I'm sorting long text in alphabetical and reverse order. I use my one sorting function which is based on prototype of bubble sort, so if you want to change sorting on more effective you can easily do it. 

`Makefile` This uses for optimazing using terminal for user. Open the folder with project in terminal.
### Makefile commands

To compile file print code in the terminal. 

```
make                // to compile your project

make clean          // to delete all object-files
```
### Warning!
1. My programm works only with English language and ASCII-code.
2. To change sorting from alphabetical to reversed or printing with space strings use macroses
```
#define WITHOUT_SPACE

#define NORMAL_SORT
```
Comment them to change mode
